Hello! My name is Mateus Gheorghe de Castro Ribeiro, I am a PhD student in the Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab (S3L) at Stanford University 🌲.

Nice to have you here on my website 😀

My passion is to leverage artificial intelligence and engineering to contribute to a better world via research 🌎👨‍💻💡

During my career, I have worked on themes that included fuzzy logic systems ✨, ultrasonic waves 🔉, signal processing 🖥️, and Structural Health Monitoring 📌

Currently, my research focuses on AI applied to sustainable energy systems - particularly machine learning applications for finding optimum solutions for merging renewables 🌤, storage 🔋, electric vehicles 🚙, and charging 🔌
